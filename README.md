# Raster Data Analysis in Python
Using the rasterio Python library, I have analyzed a raster dataset called the NLCD land use and land cover data for the year 2021. [click here to download](https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3ALand%20Cover&f%5B1%5D=year%3A2021) This analysis is limited to Florida at the county scale. A shapefile of Florida counties could be downloaded from the [Tiger shapefile](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)
